Description:
	Creates the Invoice and LineItem models for Payday to use to 
	render invoicing, and optionally a migration.
		
Usage:
	Pass the name of the Invoice and LineItems to the generator to
	establish the models and database migrations for you.  These 
	parameters can be in camel-case or in under_scored format.
	
	If no invoice_name or line_item_name is passed, it will default
	to Invoice and LineItem.
	
	If you wish to not create the migration and only have the
	models generated for you, pass the --skip-migration flag to
	the generator.
	
Examples:
	`rails generate payday:setup`
	
	Will create Invoice and LineItem models with Payday
	configured, and a database migration file to create
	the tables and the minimum Payday needs to operate.
		
	`rails generate payday:setup --invoice-name=Bill --line_item-name=Actions`
	
	Will create Bill and Actions models with Payday's 
	associations and configurations established, as well
	as a database migration for the bills and actions
	tables.
