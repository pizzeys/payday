Description:
	Creates the Invoice and LineItem models for Payday to use to 
	render invoicing.
		
Usage:
	Pass the name of the Invoice and LineItems to the generator to
	establish the models and database migrations for you.  These 
	parameters can be in camel-case or in under_scored format.
	
	If no invoice_name or line_item_name is passed, it will default
	to Invoice andLineItem.
	
	If you wish to not create the migration and only have the
	models generated for you, pass the --skip-migration flag to
	the generator.
	
Examples:
	rails generate payday:setup
	
		Will create Invoice and LineItem models with Payday
		configured, and a database migration file to create
		the tables and the minimum Payday needs to operate.
		
	rails generate payday:setup Bill Actions
	
		Will create Bill and Actions models with Payday's 
		associations and configurations established, as well
		as a database migration for the bills and actions
		tables.
