Payday!
===
Payday is a library for rendering invoices. At present it supports rendering invoices to pdfs, but we're planning on adding support for other formats in the near future.

Installing
===
Payday is available as a Rubygem, so installing it is as easy as running:

    gem install payday

Or, using bundler:

    gem "payday"


Using Payday
===
It's pretty easy to use Payday with the built in objects. We include the Invoice and LineItem classes, and with them you can get started pretty quickly.

Example:

    invoice = Payday::Invoice.new(:invoice_number => 12)
    invoice.line_items << Payday::LineItem.new(:price => 20, :quantity => 5, :description => "Pants")
    invoice.line_items << Payday::LineItem.new(:price => 10, :quantity => 3, :description => "Shirts")
    invoice.line_items << Payday::LineItem.new(:price => 5, :quantity => 200, :description => "Hats")
    invoice.render_pdf_to_file("/path/to_file.pdf")

Documentation
===
Documentation for the latest version of Payday is available at [rubydoc.info](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/payday).

Customizing Your Invoice
===
Payday::Config includes quite a few options for customizing your invoices, such as options for customizing the logo and
company details on the invoice.

Example:

    Payday::Config.default.invoice_logo = "/path/to/company/logo.png"
    Payday::Config.default.company_name = "Awesome Corp"
    Payday::Config.default.company_details = "10 This Way\nManhattan, NY 10001\n800-111-2222\nawesome@awesomecorp.com"

Using Payday with ActiveRecord Objects (or any other objects, for that matter)
===

Payday focuses on two main objects, an invoice and a line item, so to use Payday with ActiveRecord you'll want to create your own classes for those objects. We include the Payday::Invoiceable and Payday::LineItemable modules to help out with that.

Thanks to the work of Andrew Nordman, Payday includes a Rails generator that makes it super simple to generate the necessary models and migration for wiring Payday up to your app. Run `rails generate payday:setup --help` for more information about using the generator.

For a bit more fleshed out example, be sure to check out [http://github.com/commondream/payday-example](http://github.com/commondream/payday-example).

Rendering Payday PDFs To The Web
===
Payday's Invoiceable module includes methods for rendering pdfs to disk and for rendering them to a string. In a Rails controller, you can use the
render to string method to render a pdf directly to the browser like this:

In config/initializers/mime_types.rb:

    Mime::Type.register 'application/pdf', :pdf

In your controller:

    respond_to do |format|
      format.html
      format.pdf do
        send_data invoice.render_pdf, :filename => "Invoice #12.pdf", :type => "application/pdf", :disposition => "inline"
      end
    end

Be sure to restart your server after you edit the mime_types initializer. The updated setting won't take effect until you do.

I18n
===
Payday uses the i18n gem to provide support for custom labels and internationalized applications. You can change the default labels by adding a YAML file in the `config/locales` directory of your Rails app. Here are the default labels you can customize:

    en:
      payday:
        status:
          paid: PAID
          overdue: OVERDUE
          refunded: REFUNDED
        invoice:
          bill_to: Bill To
          ship_to: Ship To
          invoice_no: "Invoice #:"
          due_date: "Due Date:"
          paid_date: "Paid Date:"
          subtotal: "Subtotal:"
          tax: "Tax:"
          total: "Total:"
        line_item:
          description: Description
          unit_price: Unit Price
          quantity: Quantity
          amount: Amount

If you translate the invoice to your own language, please send me a copy of your locale.yml file so that we can include it with
the main Payday distribution and other Payday users can enjoy the fruits of your labor.

Contributing
===
Payday is pretty young, so there's still a good bit of work to be done. I highly recommend sending me a message on GitHub before making too many changes, just to make sure that two folks aren't doing the same work, but beyond that feel free to fork the project, make some changes, and send a pull request. If you're unsure about what to work on but would like to help, send me a message on GitHub. I'd love the help!

We've had some awesome contributers:

To Do
===
Here's what we're planning on working on with Payday in the near future:

* Actually get a designer to style the invoices.
* Add support for Money values
* Add support for blank line items
* Add support for indented line items
* Apply different tax rates to different line items
* Add support for shipping either pre or post tax
* Add ability to show skus or product ids on each line item
* Add ability to add fine print to invoices.

* Ability to render invoice to html for web viewing
